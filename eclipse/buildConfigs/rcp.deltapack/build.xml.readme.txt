Note: there is a build.xml file that is "overlayed" here during the build.
That build.xml comes from eclipseBuilderOverlays in the configuration 
folder of the maps project. 

The reason being is that there is a difference in the the exact features 
needed to created and assembly the delta pack. In 4.2, some of the swt
plugins moved to 
org.eclipse.e4.rcp.feature.group
where in 3.8 the are directly in 
org.eclipse.rcp.feature.group

Other than the features involved, the build.xml should be identical, so there 
could be better or different ways to "split streams" without duplicating the whole
build.xml file ... but ... for simplicity for Juno we'll leave whole build.xml 
file.
