Nothing in this directory is meant to be used "as is" ... just a working
area where I can test script in isolation which, I find I need to sometimes repeat
tests every few weeks to remind myself of how bash works :)

One nice to to, would be to create better seperated scripts, where they could
be modestly "unit tested" such as I do with test-cli.sh testing the commandLine processing.
