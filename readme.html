  2. 1.3.1 level jre installed and jre/bin directory added to system path variable.<br>
  3. 1.4 level JDK installed (for generating javadoc with working links)<br>
  4. (on non Windows systems only) - a 1.3.1 level windows java runtime environment.<br>
  5. Info-Zip zip and unzip executables on system path.<br>
  6. (for Mac OSX only) tar and gzip<br>
  7. org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder and org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder checked 
  out into a directory<br>
</p>
<p> cd to org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder directory and execute the following 
  command: </p>
<p>java -cp ../org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder/startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main 
  -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner -buildfile build.xml -Dcomponent=sdk 
  | platform | jdt | sdk.examples | sdk.tests [-Dconfigs=&lt;configuration list&gt;] 
  [javacfailonerror=true |false ] [javacVerbose=true | false][zipargs=&lt;arguments 
  to zip executable&gt;] [ -Dbootclasspath=&lt;absolute path to rt.jar to compile 
  against&gt;]<br>
