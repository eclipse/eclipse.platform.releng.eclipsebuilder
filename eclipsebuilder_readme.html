<h4><a name="description"></a>Description</h4>
<p>This document describes how to run a build from the command line which produces 
  all Eclipse SDK and runtime products. The PDE-BUILD, Ant and the JDT Core Eclipse 
  components are the techologies from build 2.1 M3 are used in this process. These, 
  along with scripts that drive the process, are contained in the combined resources 
  of <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder/">org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder</a> 
  and <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder/">org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder</a>, 
  two projects available from the dev.eclipse.org Eclipse repository.</p>
<p>PDE-BUILD is a technology in Eclipse which generates build scripts for features, 
  plugins and fragments. The script generation functions are made available via 
  custom Ant tasks (see <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.pde.build/notes/usingPDEBuild.html?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/html">documentation 
  on PDE-BUILD</a>). Calls to these tasks are contained in static Ant scripts 
  provided in the projects noted above. The JDT Core compiler is used for compiling 
  the java source code in Ant javac calls. The Ant technology in Eclipse is used 
  to run both static and generated Ant scripts.</p>
<p>This is the mechanism used by Eclipse Release Engineering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="systemrequirements"></a><b>System Requirements</b></p>
<p>The Eclipse plugins and fragments for this mechanism were taken from Windows 
  and Linux-Motif installations of the Eclipse 2.1 M3 build. It is recommended 
  that the builds are conducted on one of these two platforms.</p>
<p>The following will also be required:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sun or IBM JDK 1.3 or higher</li>
  <li> (On Linux only) Windows version of the rt.jar (bootstrap classes, classes 
    that comprise the Java platform), version 1.3.* or higher</li>
  <li><a href="http://ccvs.cvshome.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList">CVS 1.10 
    </a> or higher</li>
  <li>Info-ZIP Zip version 2.3 or higher</li>
  <li>Info-ZIP UnZip version 5.41 or higher</li>
  <li>GNU tar version 1.12 or higher</li>
  <li>&gt;1 Gigabyte free disk space (23 zip files, 6-67 meg in size, scripts, 
    all Eclipse feature, plugin and fragment projects from dev.eclipse.org)</li>
  <li><a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder/">org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder/">org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder</a></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="setup"></a><b>Initial Setup</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the JDK, CVS client, Info-ZIP Zip and Unzip, and GNU tar as per 
    each program's instructions.</li>
  <li>Add the JDK/bin directory, zip, unzip and tar executables to your path.</li>
  <li>Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK installation directory.</li>
  <li>(Windows 98) Increase the default environment space as specified <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q230205">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Export the projects org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder and org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder 
    to an empty directory created near the root of a drive to keep path lengths 
    to a minimum. The build may fail due to some paths used in file copy operations 
    exceeding 255 characters. 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/eclipse export -r &lt;tag&gt; 
        -d &lt;builderDirectory&gt; org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder</p>
      <p>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/eclipse export -r &lt;tag&gt; 
        -d &lt;builderDirectory&gt; org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder</p>
      <p>The files from both projects <u>must</u> be in the same directory for 
        path calculations.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>(Linux) set execute permission on the buildEclipse shell script, &quot;chmod 
    755 buildEclipse&quot;. </li>
</ol>

  </blockquote>
</ol>
<h4><a name="running"></a>Run the Build</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The scripts buildEclipse.bat and buildEclipse are included in the org.eclipse.releng.eclipsebuilder 
    project to invoke the Eclipse AntRunner on the Ant build scripts.</p>
  <p>To execute, use the following command from the directory containing the build 
    scripts specifying any of the optional parameters described below:</p>
  <p>buildEclipse [buildid name][buildLabel name][-buildType I|N|S|R|M][-bootclasspath 
    path][-mail] [-mapVersionTag tag][postingDirectory path]</p>

      <td width="76%"> 
        <p>The buildType specification is used to identify the build as one of 
          the following:</p>
        <p>I = Integration<br>
          N= Nightly<br>
          M= Maintenance<br>
          R= Release<br>
        S= Stable<br>
          T= Test<br>
        </p>
        <p>Specifying 'N' as the buildType will retrieve the HEAD stream of all 
          plugins, fragments and features listed in the *.map files instead of 
          using the tags specified. Typically, I and N are used for building the 
          latest development stream of Eclipse. M can be used for building a maintenance 
          stream of Eclipse. R and S are typically not used since these are usually 
          the result of promoted Integration builds. </p>

        inluded with a JRE or JDK. The default value set to the location of the 
        rt.jar included with the installed JDK. If building on Linux, the bootclasspath 
        should be set to a Windows version of the rt.jar. The Windows version 
        allows all os specific plugins and fragments to compile, whereas the Unix 
        versions will not allow the Windows specific plugins and fragments to 
        compile cleanly.</td>

          this flag will require a monitor.properties file created in the same 
          directory containing the exported build scripts. At a minimum, the monitor.properties 
          file will require key value entries such as the following:</p>

<h2><a name="limitations"></a>Known Limitations </h2>
<ol>
  <li>This mechanism includes linux-motif and windows installations of Eclipse 
    only. These scripts have only been tested on Linux 7.2 and Windows 2000\XP.</li>
  <li>Building unix flavours of Eclipse on Windows will result in incorrect file 
    permissions. The *.so, *.sl, and Eclipse executable files will not have execute 
    permissions. In addition, linux-motif builds will not have symbolic links 
    (libXm.so and libXm.so.2) to libXm.so.2.1 in the installation root directory. 
    In these cases you would have to write an install or post install script to 
    set permissionss properly. (UNIX builds built on linux-motif will set sufficient 
    permissions and make the appropriate soft links). 
  <li>When the Mac port of Eclipse is built on a Windows operating system, a soft 
    link to the root of the eclipse installation directory will be missing. The 
    following post-installation steps will be required: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>cd to Eclipse.app/Contents/Resources</li>
    <li> create a symbolic link to the eclipse installation directory by executing 
      the following command: &quot;ln -s Java ../../..&quot;</li>
    <li>cd to ../Contents/MacOS</li>
    <li>set execute permission on the eclipse file by executing this command: 
      &quot;chmod 555 eclipse&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Only Java source code is compiled. *.dll, *so, *sl and Eclipse executables 
    are all checked out of dev.eclipse.org prebuilt in this build process.</li>
  <li>This process builds all Eclipse runtime and SDK products requiring &gt; 
    1 gig of hard disk space on the build machine.</li>
  <li> InfoZIP Zip and Unzip are used to preserve file permissions when extracting 
    or creating zip files. The dependency on using these should be removed in 
    future releases by using the Ant tar and zip/unzip tasks instead.</li>
